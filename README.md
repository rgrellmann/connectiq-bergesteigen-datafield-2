# connectiq-bergsteigen-datafield-2
A DataField for Garmin Smart Watches intended as a second page (1-Field-Layout) for mountain tours.

For my DataField intended for the first page see rgrellmann/connectiq-bergsteigen-datafield-1

This is a DataField which can be added to activity apps on Garmin smartwatches.
Currently it is only working on the v√≠voactive 3 series.
Currently only english and german translations are available.

This DataField contains informations which may be useful on mountain tours, but not of permanent interest or not frequently needed.
Values on this DataField:
* current position (latitude/longitude in decimal degrees, like on Google Maps)
* current heading (degrees and letters)
* time of sunrise and time of sunset at the current location
* burned calories during this activity
* elapsed distance during this activity (in my opinion the ascent and descent are more important during mountain tours, so these values are on DataField 1)
* battery status icon
* current clock time
* current temperature in degrees celsius
* current barometric pressure and mean sea level pressure (altitude and temperature compensated value) in hPa
